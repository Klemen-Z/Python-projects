-Introduction
	This is a text adventure game that currently has three charachters
	(They will be listed later). All charachters have pros and cons (also
	listed later on). There are currently ten possible events (not listed
	you have to find them.:) ).


-Characters
	1. Mary (mage)
	Mary can change the world around her
	2. Oberon (elf)
	Oberon's veins flow with elven blood
	3. Terra (dragon)
	Terra soars through the sky using the powerful wings 
 	that belong to the dragons


-Character pros an cons
	1.Mary
	Can use magic to ward off curses and attack enemies. They attempt
	to help others but end up being less than helpfull if they make a mistake
	which is why all their choices have chances to fail. 
	2.Oberon
	The Elves are skilled archers and can communicate with trees, however they are not on
	good terms with the dragons and are very trusting of strangers and friends alike.
	3.Terra
	Dragons aren't stopped by terrain (cliffs, mountains,etc)
	however they are not in good terms with any of they in game races, and cannot walk
	for long periods of time.


-Game mechanics
	1. Randomized events.
	2. Character selector.
	3. Enemies that can be friendly depending on their in game race.
	4. Seperate in game races (currently only three).
	5. Fight mechanics.
	6. Special choices for each character where it makes sense.
	7. A story that is written as the game progresses and is rewritten,
	 when the game begins again
	8. A log of the actions and events picked

-Way to play
	You must type in the number of your choice (must be a number)(min.1)
	(max.3 (4 if special choice included)). The player has partial control
	over the story's ending (death, success, or retired as options).
-Future Updates
	Adding more in game races.
	Adding more possible events.
	Adding more possible choices (diplomacy or something like that).
	Better, smoother, more efficient code.
